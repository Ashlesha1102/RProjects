# RProjects
Here is a compilation of all Data Science projects in R I have done as a part of my course curriculum
# Capstone project
The objective of this project was to create a Data Analytical platform for one of the client's products - Smart Shelf App.
For this, RShiny was used to build a proof of concept.
